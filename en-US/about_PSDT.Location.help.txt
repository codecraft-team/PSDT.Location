SHORT DESCRIPTION
        PSDT.Location is a collection of PowerShell cmdlets, which improves developer productivity.

LONG DESCRIPTION
        The PowerShell Developer Tools for Location simplifies navigation within one PSDrive.
        
        PSDT.Location is shipped with a built-in (nested) module, which is intended to encapsulate 
        common PSDT application logic. 
         
        The following functionality is supported:
        
        * Finding container child items of current location
        * Use wildcard and/or words to filter child items
        * Navigate directly to child item (uses Push-Location under the hood)
